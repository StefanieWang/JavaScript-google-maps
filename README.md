# Project: Putting Google Maps Onto Your Site with Javascript

Interacting with the `Google Maps API` for The Odin Project's [Project: Putting Google Maps Onto Your Site with Javascript.](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/putting-google-maps-onto-your-site)

1. It's a simple site that has just a Google map on it and a form where the user can enter a latitude and longitude and a message. 
2. When the form is submitted, a marker is placed on the map in that location. 
3. Clicking the marker will bring up the message that was entered.
4. `jQuery's Validate plugin` is also used to validate the form.
